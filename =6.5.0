The conflict is caused by:
    pyqt6-tools 6.4.2.3.3 depends on pyqt6-plugins<6.4.2.3 and >=6.4.2.2.2
    pyqt6-tools 6.3.1.3.3 depends on pyqt6-plugins<6.3.1.3 and >=6.3.1.2.2
    pyqt6-tools 6.1.0.3.2 depends on pyqt6-plugins<6.1.0.3 and >=6.1.0.2.2
    pyqt6-tools 6.0.3.3.2 depends on pyqt6-plugins<6.0.3.3 and >=6.0.3.2.2
    pyqt6-tools 6.0.2.3.2 depends on pyqt6-plugins<6.0.2.3 and >=6.0.2.2.2
    pyqt6-tools 6.0.1.3.2 depends on pyqt6-plugins<6.0.1.3 and >=6.0.1.2.2

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
